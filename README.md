- 👋 Hi, I’m @rangel-marco4
- 👀 I’m interested in: web, mobile, and embedded software development! Additionally, I would love to advance my skills in data structures and algorithms in the hopes of masterting
- them to the best of my abilities!
- 🌱 I’m currently: learning more data structures and algorithms, their theories and implementations, mostly in C++ as that is my preferred language. But this is also because
- much of embedded software is written in c/c++ and I happen to really enjoy these languages!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: web, mobile, or embedded software projects that would be a great learning experience!
- 📫 How to reach me: you can always reach me through my linkedIn account or email (mrangel0400@gmail.com)!
